# [Rose](https://crackmes.one/crackme/675410a360fa67152406b51a)
## Description:
A crackme with multiple "stages" starting at beginner level, and progressively gets harder.
x64dbg is recommended as i only tested it with that.
Patching IS allowed and required for some stages (even some password/key stages).
If the text is annoying/takes too long, patch out the print function.

Make sure to not change save.txt or delete it.
If you think it's too easy, only use static analysis/patching to crack.
